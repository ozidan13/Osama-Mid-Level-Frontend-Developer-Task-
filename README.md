# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### creating a page with the following details:-

1) create an array of objects (containing 6 objects) where each object represents a product with the following properties:-
- product_name (string, ex: "Gold Coin")
- product_price (string, ex: "112.55")
- product_image (string, ex: "gold-coin.png")
- added_to_cart (boolean, ex: false)

2) create a page where there are 6 product cards displayed with all their details

3) each product card contains name, price, image, add_to_cart button and quick_view button

4) create a cart icon in the navbar, which opens a dropdown with added_to_cart products

5) the cart icon should have an indicator to the number of added_to_cart products

6) create a quick_view modal which is opened whenever the user clicks on the quick_view button of any product

7) the quick_view modal has the same details displayed in the product card

8) adding the product to cart or removing it will affect all places where the product is displayed (product card, navbar dropdown, quick_view modal)

9) if the product is added_to_cart, the "add to cart" button should be converted to "remove from cart"

10) use localStorage to store the array of products, don't use the default array mentioned in first step if there is an array in the localStorage

11) you are only allowed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but you can't use jQuery, Bootstrap, Fontawesome (you can use icons but you don't need to attach a whole library of icons), Google Fonts (you can just download and use any single font), etc..

12) feel free to use any ui/ux design, but make sure that your design is responsive
